	I don’t remember exactly when I made my first trade, but I do know I got hooked in August 2004. That was the month I took off work and read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471678759/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0471678759&linkCode=as2&tag=stockpeer-20&linkId=ECAXSYX5URVNVWQN">McMillan on Options by Lawrence G. McMillan</a> cover to cover—and then spent the rest of the stint fervently writing a software program to scan the options market and media websites to identify trading opportunities (#goodtimes). Since then I have spent countless hours tinkering with the software to facilitate options trading.

	Although the more interesting tidbits I have to share with the interwebs involve options trading and software, I do invest in (but do not trade) equity stocks and real estate and occasionally share my opinions related to longer term financial growth. I believe that trading and investing are not mutually exclusive and can be combined for more robust wealth creation.

	I am not one of those super slick dudes surrounded by rows of LCD monitors filled with mesmerizing graphs. I have a day job as the founder and CEO of <a href="http://cloudmanic.com">Cloudmanic Labs</a>, a small web and mobile software company. The Stockpeer blog explores the many links between my trading and investing activities and my work at Cloudmanic Labs in greater detail.
